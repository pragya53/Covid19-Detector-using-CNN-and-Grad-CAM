# Covid19-Detector-using-CNN-and-Grad-CAM

The aim of this project is to detect the presence of coronavirus in the patients using the X-ray images of their chest using CNN. Furthermore, the biomarkers that give rise to predictions such as spatial features, colour density are also identified using the Grad-CAM technique.
 
 # Dataset
 
  The dataset comprises of chest X-ray and CT images of patients who are positive or suspected of COVID-19 and the normal patients.
  Both the classes have been equally distributed in the dataset and well-shuffled to reduce the bias.
